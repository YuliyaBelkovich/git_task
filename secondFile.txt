My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun,
Coral is far more red, than her lips red,
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun:
If hairs be wiresm black wires grow on her head:
I hav seen roses damasked, red and white,
But no such roses see I in her cheeks,
And in some perfumes is there more delight,
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know,
That music hath a par more pleasing sound:
But, lo! from forth a copse that neighbours by
A breeding jennet, lusty, young, and proud
